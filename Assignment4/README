Assignment 4 README

This program simulates the interactions between Dogs of different breeds and a Kennel.
There are three different breeds of dogs: Ridgeback, Coonhounds, and Doodles.
Each dog tries to get in line to eat, and then waits its turn to eat.
No two breeds are allowed to eat together. Many dogs of the same breed can go in to the kennel at the same time.
The only exception is the Doodle, as only one Doodle is allowed in due to the assignment outlines.

To run:
    make small
    make large

The simulation will be run with either large or small parameters. The only parameters that can be passed in
are the amounts of each type of dog. Look at the Makefile to see how this is done. To stop, use Ctrl + C.

For the Promela programs, use spin in order to run them. The output should show you everything you need.
EX. spin -run spin/students.pml
