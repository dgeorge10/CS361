Assigment 3 README

This program simulates the interactions between multiple agents in a hypothetical society.
There are three different types of residents:
	Farmers
	Truckers
	GroceryWorkers

Each Resident has its own rules for how they interact with each other.
These rules are detailed in my report, and also the assignment guidelines.

Running the program:
	make small
	make large
			
The simulation will be run with either large or small parameters. See the Makefile for details.
To stop, use Ctrl + c. Please also see Makefile for details on the parameters that need to be passed in order for the simlation to run. 
Every one of the targets that I have included, has all of the appropriate parameters. Any missing parameters will cause the program to not run.
