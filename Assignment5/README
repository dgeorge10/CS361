CS361 Assignment 5 README

This program simulates the interactions between Dogs of different breeds and a Kennel.
There are three different breeds of dogs: Ridgeback, Coonhounds, and Doodles.
Each dog tries to get in line to eat, and then waits its turn to eat.
No two breeds are allowed to eat together. Many dogs of the same breed can go in to the kennel at the same time.
The only exception is the Doodle, as only one Doodle is allowed in due to the assignment outlines.

In order to run this program, use the following command template

go run dogs.go NUM_COONHOUNDS NUM_DOODLES NUM_RIDGEBACKS

For example:
go run dogs.go 3 3 3

Anything that doesn't match this format will not successfully run the program.
In order to stop the simulation, use CTRL + C. There was no indication on when to stop the simulation,
so I chose to leave that up to the tester.
