Assignment1 Part2 submission

I recommend running the solutions on TUX, but the code can be imported into IntelliJ.
Assignment1/ contains my sequential implementation.
Assignment1Part2/ contains my implementation for the static division of labor.
Assignment1Part2b/ contains my implementation for the dynamic division of labor.

The code can be ran by navigating to the appropriate directory and using the Makefile.
EX.
	cd Assignment1Part2b/
	make square

The output files should appear in bin/ once the program terminates.

wiki.txt is the notes file that I created while working on my wiki entries. These values are also recorded
in my reprt PDF file.
